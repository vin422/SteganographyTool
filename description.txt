CLASSES
Steganography (base): basic features, loading image, files,abstract base class
Hideandseek (derived): hide and recover messages in plaintext
Encryptor: encrypts the message with XOR encryption
SecureSteganography: both hiding and encrypting using multiple inheritance
Main: uses all the functionality

LIBRARIES
iostream: printing
fstream: reading files
string: using text
exception: handling errors

So far i have used oop design like multiple inheritance and polymorphism and destructors for organized memory management. also friend operator overloading has been used in the encryptor class.

The encryption logic already works (the xor encryption/decryption) and can already be tested

It can already be compiled

What to be implemented next:
1) Real image files, so instead of loadImage() and saveImage() its gonna be an actual bitmap reading.
2) LSB text embedding: inside the encde() each char will be converted to binary and the least significant bits of each image byte with bits of the secret message. decryption will work vise versa
3) error handling (memory allocation, file reading etc
4) possibly more advanced features

Important note: I have used chatGPT and other resourses during this stage. however, i have done so wisely and only used it for learning purposes. rest assured, i can confidently speak up for each line of code if necessary. thank you for your time.
